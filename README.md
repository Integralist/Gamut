##Disclaimer

I've not checked any of these files in a very very long time. This is quite literally a 'code dump'.

The majority of this code is my own, but there will be sections that have come from other sources and authors (e.g. if I've been testing a framework or I've borrowed a function from somewhere). But there were so many files it wasn't feasible for me to go back and try and check each line of code. So if you are one of those people/authors and you notice a bit of code is yours and you would like to be credited appropriately then please do get in contact and let me know and I'll ensure that happens! But for the moment I'm just dumping this stuff online.
