This sample is a photo gallery application with thumbnails. It provides an example of using ActionScript to control movie clips dynamically. The gallery_tween.xml file lists the images to load.

The Flash gallery is created at runtime from an XML file. 
Images are loaded on the Stage and scaled to 20% of their original size, but you can see the full-size image by clicking an image and keeping the mouse button pressed. You can also drag the image around the Stage. Releasing the mouse button returns the image to its correct location and thumbnail state. The images are rotated slightly and have a border (using the drawing API). Thumbnails are made from the larger images.
