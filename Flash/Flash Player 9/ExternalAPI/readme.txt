Load files to a server to run this sample. Next, load the external.html file to view the sample. 

This sample, external.fla, demonstrates how to use the External API (ExternalInterface class) to create interaction between the browser and your SWF file. In this sample, HTML form controls on a web page let you manipulate and display information about an FLV video that plays in a SWF file. Messages from the SWF file appear in an HTML text field.

Files needed for this example are external.fla, external.html, external.swf, and AC_RunActiveContent.js.

Another External API sample is in the simple example folder.
