This sample, xmlmenu.fla, demonstrates how to create a dynamic menu with XML data. The sample calls the ActionScript XmlMenu() constructor and passes it two parameters: the path to the XML menu file and a reference to the current timeline. The rest of the functionality resides in a custom class file, XmlMenu.as. The XmlMenu class depends on two symbols in the Library: link_mc and menu_mc. The link_mc symbol is used for the submenu items and the menu_mc symbol is used for main navigation items.The menu.xml file is a supporting file.
