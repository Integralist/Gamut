This sample, CustomizingContextMenu.fla,  uses ActionScript to customize the Flash Player context menu.

Right-click three instances on the Stage and cut, copy, and paste them. Cutting the instance sets the alpha accordingly so the instance is semi-transparent. Paste the symbols as much as you want. The symbols are also draggable.

The ActionScript file (ClipBoard.as) is used as an external class (_global.myClipboard = new ClipBoard();).
