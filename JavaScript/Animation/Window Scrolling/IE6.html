      <p>Company does not support IE6 (Internet Explorer 6). Below is an outline of why we've made this decision and relevant links to more appropriate, more secure browsers.</p>
      <p>The internet is constantly evolving and moving forward, implementing new and exciting features and technology. As part of this progression to a better web experience, older software needs to be upgraded to both make sure users are protected from known security flaws and to be able to fully enjoy the rich experience modern web applications provide. Our decision to no longer support IE6 is based on its inability to handle basic design features, technological advances or, most importantly, the ability to implement satisfactory security protection and prevention.</p>
      <p>Putting this in context, at the start of 2010, several leading governmental organisations and companies – both in the UK and abroad – began the process of removing support for this browser. Most noticeably, the Department of Health advised the NHS to move away from IE6 for all its communications. Indeed, the Cabinet Office has already issued advisory guidance to central government on how to deal with problems concerning the use of IE6, while government agencies across Europe are advising all internet users to stop using IE6 completely. Google has also abandoned support, with recent security threats to the site pinpointed to use of the browser.</p>
      <p>Company therefore recommends the use of other, more up-to-date browsers. Upgrading your browser is free and is very simple. There are many good browsers available. To find out more – or to download them – simply click on the links below:</p>
