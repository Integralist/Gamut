<title>JavaScript: The Singleton Pattern</title>
</head>
<body>

	<h1>The Singleton Pattern</h1>
   <p>The Singleton pattern utilize closures to create a protected variable space.</p>
   <p>The singleton pattern uses a returned object literal to expose privileged members, while keeping private members protected in the enclosing functionâ€™s scope.</p>
   <p>It uses the technique where an outer function is executed immediately and the result is assigned to a variable.</p>
   <p>The singleton pattern provides a way to group code into a logical unit that can be accessed through a single variable. By ensuring that there is only one copy of a singleton object, you know that all of your code makes use of the same global resource.</p>
