VIM has two modes (INSERT and NORMAL)
Esc = NORMAL
i = INSERT

Move cursor
h = left
l = right
k = up
j = down

Quit without saving
:q!

Quit and save
:wq

Delete a character from the document without moving to insert mode
Press x where cursor is position

If you want to append text to the bottom of a document (not same as INSERT mode where you edit from cursor location)
Press A (capital A!)

Moving the cursor in NORMAL mode (VIM has 'motions' to assist here)
e = move cursor to the end of a word (this places the cursor at the last character of the word)
w = move cursor to the start of the next word (same as pressing alt+left/right key) but only moves forward.

In the regex world, e would be equivalent to \w+\b where as w would be equivalent to \w+\s\b

Using a counter with a 'motion'
3e = moves cursor to the end of the 3rd word (moving forward)
2w = moves cursor position two words (moving forward)
0 = moves cursor to start of the line

Delete a word in your document (including space after the word)
Go to NORMAL mode, place cursor in relevant place and type dw (this is the d 'operator' with the w 'motion')

Delete a word in your document (excluding space after the word)
Go to NORMAL mode, place cursor in relevant place and type de (this is the d 'operator' with the e 'motion')

Delete multiple consecutive words (including space after the word)
Go to NORMAL mode, place cursor in relevant place and type d3w (this is the d 'operator' & w 'motion' with a counter of 3)

Delete multiple consecutive words (excluding space after the word)
Go to NORMAL mode, place cursor in relevant place and type d3e (this is the d 'operator' & e 'motion' with a counter of 3)

Delete an entire line of the document
Go to NORMAL mode, place cursor at the start of a line and type d$
Due to the frequency of this requirement, VIM implements a shortcut of dd

Undo a single command
u

Undo all changes on a line (return it to it's original unsaved state)
U

The format for a change command is:
operator   [number]   motion
where:
	operator - is what to do, such as  d  for delete
     [number] - is an optional count to repeat the motion
     motion   - moves over the text to operate on, such as  w (word), $ (to the end of line), etc.

Move text without copy/paste
First delete the text you want to copy (odd I know), but that text is stored and then use the p operator to put back where you want

Replace single character (without going to INSERT mode)
Place cursor at position of character and press r followed by new character which will replace the current character

Replace entire word (without going to INSERT mode - although it'll put you in INSERT mode after!)
Place cursor at position of character and press ce followed by new word which will replace from the current cursor position till end.
Notice this is the 'change' operator followed with the 'e' operator (which acts like a word boundary but ignores spaces).
